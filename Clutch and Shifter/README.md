Please see README.md in the "Magnetic Paddle Shifters" directory. This file only explains the different file types.


* SLDPRT - these are the main 3D model files. CAD software is Solidworks 2014
* STEP - these are exports of the SLDPRT file. You should be able to use these to import the 3D model into the CAD software of your choice.
* STL - these are the files you may use to print the object. These are oriented correctly so just add them to your slicer to create the gcode file for your printer.
