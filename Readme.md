This repository contains the 3D models and STL files required to 3D print your own formula style steering wheel.     
The magnetic shifter design has been tested for over a year and the steering wheel for a few months. Everything has performed without any issues while being used on my OSW with small Mige motor.    

**Still, you use the wheel at your own risk. I am not responsible for ANY issues, injuries, deaths, fires, world wars, ... that result from using any of my designs.**     


Assembly instructions and the Bill of Materials may be found in the Wiki. [Steering Wheel Assembly Instructions](https://github.com/KaiserSoft/3d-printed-formula-style-steering-wheel/wiki)     
    
The firmware can be used to create button boxes, back plates for steering wheels or entire wheels like this one. Due to this modular approach the firmware is hosted in a seperate repository. [Firmware for Steering Wheel](https://github.com/KaiserSoft/simwheel-firmware-arduino-pro-micro)
